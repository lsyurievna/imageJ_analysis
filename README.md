The project I did while working for Dr. Erika Merschrod who is doing Physical Chemistry. 
The goal of the project is to batch process Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images of 
cobal ferrite nanoparticles and determine their cross-sectional areas.

As an example, here is what an SEM image typically looks like. You can see a few nanoparticles 
in their beautiful trigonal bipyramidal form:

To make analysis easier, the image will be transformed into black and white as follows:

The area of the black shapes is then calculated in pixels, and converted to nanometers based on how many pixels fit
into the black rectangle on the bottom.
